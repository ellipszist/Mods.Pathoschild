The Central Station has hidden lore, which players can discover in-game through indirect hints. If you add custom
content which mentions Central Station, this lore guide can help you keep it consistent.

## General guidelines
This section has light spoilers.

1. The hidden lore is meant to be a vague background 'feel' to the station.  
   _It should rarely be hinted at, and never directly mentioned or explained. If you want to hint at the lore in custom
   content, see the next section._
2. Central Station can only be reached and left via boat/bus/train transit lines.  
   _NPCs shouldn't mention reaching it any other way (e.g. walking, driving, or taking their own boat), and shouldn't
   mention going outside the station._
3. It's connected to regular boat/bus/train lines.  
   _NPCs and players who transit through the station generally don't know there's anything unusual about it._
4. Who runs and maintains Central Station is never revealed.  
   _In-game authorities like [the governor](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Governor) are aware of the station and have
   permits issued, but don't recall who filed them. Nobody works for the station (e.g. the shop keepers are independent).
   No company has maintenance contracts with the station (e.g. for upkeep or maintenance)._

## Hidden lore
### Overview
> [!WARNING]  
> **This section has heavy spoilers, including details that are never directly revealed in-game.**  
> If you want the intended player experience, do not read this section.

The Central Station is a realm within the spirit world run by unknown but friendly spirits. You can't reach the station
through normal means (e.g. driving along the road which the bus takes), and every transit destination seems to be
reachable (e.g. bus stops on another continent).

This spirit world is more dynamic and changeable than the physical world. The Central Station is kept stable for its
passengers, but sometimes the spirit world seeps through in a momentary flicker. For players, this is visible as rare
[strange occurrences](#strange-occurrences). The chance of seeing a strange occurrence is directly related to the
amount of time you've spent in the spirit world, which gradually accumulates a link to it.

None of this is ever directly revealed to players or NPCs, and it's not possible to discover who runs the station and
remember it. For example, there's a rare chance to see this message when you click the ticket counter:
> _(Suddenly you can see through the tinted glass, just for a moment. When you think back, you can't remember what you
> saw.)_

The spirits who operate the station are never described in any detail, only indirectly or via their actions. For
example, other rare messages state:
> (You try to peer into the ticket booth, but there's just a vague shadow through the tinted glass.)  
> (You hear strange whispers through the glass.)  
> (This machine only sells Joja Cola, but something thuds into the pickup tray as you approach.)

Messages which hint at this lore are generally eerie, strange, or otherworldly. However the spirits are always
friendly, helpful, or playfully mischievous; they are _never_ threatening, scary, malicious, or hurtful.

### Strange occurrences
> [!WARNING]  
> **This section has heavy spoilers, including details that are never directly revealed in-game.**  
> If you want the intended player experience, do not read this section.

Strange occurrences are rare messages, sounds, or changes which hint at the [hidden lore](#overview). These only happen
when inside the Central Station itself and only after you've visited it a number of times. These are always brief and
easy to ignore (both for lore reasons and to allow for players who only care about the actual transport feature).

In most cases, you can only see one strange occurrence per visit.

Here are the current strange occurrences:

Clicking the cola machine shows a strange message and provides a free drink (with an equal chance of Joja Cola or a
random drink). The messages don't repeat within the same session unless you've already seen the others.
